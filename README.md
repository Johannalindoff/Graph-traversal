# ✈️ Does it exist a path between two airports?
This assignment was conducted in the course "Data Structures and Algorithms (C)". 
The main task was to use existing data type implementations to implement graph algorithms.
The algorithms had to present for the user if it exists a path between two airports 
based on a textfile. An example of such a textfile is "airmap1.map" above. 
The algorithms that was developed can be found in the files "graph.c" and "is_connected.c".
